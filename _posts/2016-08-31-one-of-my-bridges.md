Welp, I suppose I should be a little more proud of what I do on the nine-to-five in addition to the six-to-eleven. So check out this video:

No, I'm not a drone pilot. I designed the electrical and control system for that bridge. It's a pretty typical project, of which we do several a year. (Well, this particular one is not _entirely_ typical because most of our bridges are bascules—seesaw types—instead of swings as you see here. But close enough.)
