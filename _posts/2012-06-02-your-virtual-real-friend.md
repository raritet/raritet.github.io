Looks creepy, yes, but the concept is actually interesting: Say you have an internet buddy somewhere, but that somewhere is far away. Well, just give him or her control of your <a title="Japanese MH-2 Shoulder Robot at IEEE Spectrum" href="http://spectrum.ieee.org/automaton/robotics/humanoids/japanese-mh2-shoulder-robot-wants-to-be-your-friend-literally" target="_blank">shoulder mounted robot pal</a> and the two of you can partake in all manner of activities together!
