This Colombian group Systema Solar is pretty rad. If I had to describe it to a layperson, I would say it's something like Colombian reggaeton, but vastly more interesting, and as such, vastly better. I've been all up in this Latin roots dance thing lately. I'll have to post some other examples. I think it all started for me when I came across <a title="Poirier on the Nunja Tune site." href="http://ninjatune.net/us/artist/poirier" target="_blank">Poirier</a> on the <a title="Ninja Tune" href="http://ninjatune.net/us" target="_blank">Ninja Tune</a> label. Even Afropop worldwide had a show about it. Oh, and NPR has featured a few of these bands, too.
