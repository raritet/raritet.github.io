I have a theory. It's pure, arbitrary conjecture, but it's rising to the level of a gut feeling (with, perhaps, a little wishful thinking drizzled on for good measure).

We all know that Herman Cain is riding high right now. We also know that the Republican establishment doesn't consider him a truly viable candidate. But <em>a lot</em> of people like him for his slogans and folksiness. I think that he will more or less lose the Republican primaries but will still have enough backing (and enough hubris) to forge ahead an do it alone, using his personal wealth along with a bunch of small donations to, in essence, spoil the election for the Republicans.

Of course he and his supporters won't think they're spoiling the election. The right is stuck in their own echo chamber right now and they feel that everyone but a few hippies in Zuccotti Park is on their side. Cain would think Obama has such little support that it would, in effect, be a two-way race between him and Romney.

I'm not sure how likely I really think this scenario could be. But I might as well get it in writing so I can look smart in the odd chance it does pan out.
