Having grown up in Miami (and having paid attention to my surroundings), I more or less knew about Cuba's DIY culture. Rarely has a cliche ever been so accurate as "necessity is the mother of invention" in special period Cuba.

When I heard that we would soon have our very own <a title="Miami Mini Maker Faire" href="http://makerfairemiami.com/" target="_blank">Miami Mini Maker Faire</a>, on November 16 to be exact, I immediately thought of all the Cuban hacks I had heard about over the years, and then lamented, perhaps prematurely, that they would not be included in the Faire. We'll see if word makes it out to the right communities. I started by dropping a line in the contact box at <a title="Ernesto Oroza" href="http://www.ernestooroza.com/" target="_blank">Ernesto Oroza's</a> website, though I'm pretty sure it will take a lot more than that.
