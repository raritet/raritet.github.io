Apparently in China people do water calligraphy. Not all people, of course; from the video it looks like just the elderly. But I don't know that for sure either. In any case, it looks really nice. Drop a western geek into the mix, though, and you get a computerized dot-matrix water calligraphy system. I, for one, think it is an exceptional idea and quite amusing.
