Holy fiddlesticks! How is it that I only learned of Debo Band<em> just now</em>?

My most loyal followers among you will recognize the melody from a silly remix of this tune I did some time back. I think it was from an old Tlahoun Gessesse album. I don't really feel like linking to it because it's more than a little <em>too</em> silly.
