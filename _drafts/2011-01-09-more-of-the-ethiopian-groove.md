This is an update to a previous upload. I just cleaned up a few things here and there. Now's the time to try to make a song. I want to thicken the atmosphere a bit still, to keep the interest since it's just a groove, really.

I suppose I should give a little background on the samples... The main Ethiopian funk sample comes from a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fentity%2FMahmoud-Ahmed%2FB000AQ1VA2%3Fie%3DUTF8%26ref_%3Dep_artist_tab_glance%26sn%3Dd&amp;tag=twittcoher-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957">Mahmoud Ahmed</a><img style="border:none!important;margin:0!important;" src="https://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=twittcoher-20&amp;l=ur2&amp;o=1" border="0" alt="" width="1" height="1" /> song called <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0014XK5V6?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=twittcoher-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B0014XK5V6">Bemen Sebeb Letlash</a><img style="border:none!important;margin:0!important;" src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=twittcoher-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B0014XK5V6" border="0" alt="" width="1" height="1" />. It's basically the first bar of the song. This guy called Gaslamp Killer, who makes a similar style of music as me, has a song that uses pretty much the whole song as a sample with the creepy voice of Gonja Sufi laid on top singing something or other. It's called <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0043XBR84?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=twittcoher-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B0043XBR84">When I'm In Awe</a><img style="border:none!important;margin:0!important;" src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=twittcoher-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B0043XBR84" border="0" alt="" width="1" height="1" />. I'm not sure where the break comes from, though. The sample's filename is soul_chicken.wav if that helps.
