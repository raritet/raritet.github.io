I love this illustration work by <a title="The Illustrations of Kimiaki Yaegashi" href="http://www.okimi.com/" target="_blank">Kimiaki Yaegashi</a>. I get this feeling like everything there means something. But I have absolutely no clue what those somethings are.

<a href="http://okimi.heteml.jp/okimiblog/2011/11/meet-again.html"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-398" title="Kimiaki Yaegashi Rabbit" src="http://squishyrobot.files.wordpress.com/2011/11/kimiaki_yaegashi_rabbit.jpg" alt="" width="360" height="360" /></a>

Via <a title="Kimiaki Yaegashi at Sex in Art" href="http://www.sexinart.net/2011/11/20/kimiaki-yaegashi/" target="_blank">Sex in Art</a> (Note that there is no sex in the art at this link, but if you go snooping around something not safe for work/wife might pop up, depending on your wife.)
