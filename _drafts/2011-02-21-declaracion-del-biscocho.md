Just messing around with this one. When I'm at work listening to my music collection, if I come across something that sounds like it would make a good sample I set it aside. Then that evening I go home and make a beat. Sometimes I'll make two or three a day. (Yes, that means you are waiting for me to upload quite a few.)
