This one is turning out to be one of my favorites so far. I like how the main sample wobbles around and how the groove works together pretty solidly (except that maybe the central drum loop is a little too active). I'm not happy with the little scratches that pop up from time to time in the guitar part, but I think I'm the only one that notices.
