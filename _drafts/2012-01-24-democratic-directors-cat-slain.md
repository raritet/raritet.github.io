I would like to note that you don't find dead puppies with "conservative" scribbled on them. Or even "Nazi" for that matter.

This leads me back to this whole thing I've been thinking about over the years regarding the outsized negative reaction people have to hippies and other peaceful odd balls. It's fairly mystifying, to say the least. I'd like to some day sit down and do the research to write an essay about this. Does the same thing happen in other cultures? Can it be linked to our prehistory? Is it perhaps an important instinct people have to keep society together that just gets out of hand sometimes?
