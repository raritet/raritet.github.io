So <a title="Nu-Whirled Music on Afropop Worldwide" href="http://www.afropop.org/radio/radio_program/ID/764" target="_blank">here's</a> the episode of <a title="Afropop Worldwide" href="http://www.afropop.org/" target="_blank">Afropop Worldwide</a> where they talk about this new electronic roots dance music thing.

I didn't realize that Diplo is really responsible for bringing baile funk to the indie mainstream (if that oxymoron "indie mainstream" makes any sense). By the way, a prediction: You will hear flavors of the baile funk sound in popular hip hop tunes soon.

Interestingly, if you play even the hippest, silliest American baile funk tune to a Brazilian, they don't really seem to appreciate it and will tell you about how that music comes from exceptionally low class people. There are some Brazilian hipsters like the kids in <a title="Bonde do Rolê on Myspace" href="http://www.myspace.com/bondedorole" target="_blank">Bondê do Role</a> that get the irony, but for most there is a pretty bad association with the sound.
