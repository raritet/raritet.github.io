If you have ever wondered what all this open source, new media art, creative coding, whatever you want to call it stuff is that I like to talk and repost about... well here is a nice introductory video for a larger project on the subject:

[vimeo https://vimeo.com/28499650]

I've made a few projects of my own in <a title="Processing" href="http://processing.org/" target="_blank">Processing</a>, one of the languages mentioned. You used to be able to access them through this blog, but I think the links are broken. Anyway, the new way to let people see your Processing sketches is with Processing.js embedded in web pages. So I guess that means I have to go port my old sketches now...
