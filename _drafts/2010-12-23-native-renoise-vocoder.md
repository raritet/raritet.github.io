Someone posted a Venetian Snares track on the <a title="The Renoise home page." href="http://www.renoise.com" target="_blank">Renoise</a> IRC channel earlier this afternoon. There was a part in it where a drum line modulates a synthesizer sound like a vocoder. It got me wondering if such a thing is possible to do natively in Renoise. So I made a mess of routing and created a 3-band vocoder using just built-in Renoise DSPs.
