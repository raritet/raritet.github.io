<a title="My Itch-o-Skatch Processing sketch." href="http://squishyrobot.com/processing/itch-o-skatch/applet/" target="_blank">This</a> is the first step in my Etch-a-Sketch clone. I need to come up with a creative input method. Something gestural, like everything else these days.

(Do those sides correspond to a real Etch-a-Sketch?) And the 'c' key clears the drawing.
