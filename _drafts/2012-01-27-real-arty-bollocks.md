Some time back I posted <a title="With “Arty Bollocks Generator” I Don’t Even Need to Write My Own Artist’s Statement!" href="http://squishyrobot.wordpress.com/2011/11/27/with-arty-bollocks-generator-i-dont-even-need-to-write-my-own-artists-statement/" target="_blank">something</a> about an automatic arty bollocks generator. I found it amusing, but a little over the top.

That is, until now.

I came across this <a title="Shopping Totem by David Welch at 20x200" href="http://www.20x200.com/artworks/3582-david-welch-shopping-totem" target="_blank">photograph</a> (which I like a lot) and read the associated statement (which I abhor). Let me amplify. Actually, let the artist amplify on his own behalf:
<blockquote>By treating artifacts of consumer culture as Duchampian-inspired Assisted Readymades, I photograph assemblages, created by my own hand, that form monuments, or totems, serving as precarious externalizations of culture and social biography.</blockquote>
Isn't "Duchampian-inspired Assisted Readymade" redundant at best? Could he mean that he's getting back to the roots of readymade and isn't inspired by anyone after Duchamp. Nope, because that would be "Duchamp-inspired." And does "Assisted Readymade" really warrant title case? How about that bit about "precarious externalizations?" I hope he's using "externalization" in a Freudian sense, in which case there could be a lot of interesting meaning there. But after that redundant first half of the sentence, I'm not so sure.
