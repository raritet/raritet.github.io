Fantastic. I've always been fascinated by clever displays, and <a title="Valentin Ruhry &quot;Untitled&quot;" href="http://ruhry.artfolder.net/untitled-hello-world.html" target="_blank">this one</a> is certainly no exception. Make sure to follow through and see how it works. Hopefully people can play with it. And while you're at <a title="Valentin Ruhry" href="http://ruhry.artfolder.net/" target="_blank">Valentin Ruhry's site</a>, make sure to check out the rest of his stuff. It's pretty rad.
