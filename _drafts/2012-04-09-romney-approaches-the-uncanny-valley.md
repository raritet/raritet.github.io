People always make fun of Romney's curious way of speaking. Perhaps the best example I can think of off the cuff is an interview where he said that, were he to coordinate with a Super PAC, he would "go to the big house," meaning the clink, up the river, the lockup, the slammer. He sounds like a robot programmed to sound like a B actor cold-reading a script from a late '30s radio show.

That robot thing is apparently, uh, a <em>thing</em>, now: <a title="The Uncanny Valley: What Robot Theory Tells Us About Mitt Romney at The Atlantic" href="http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2012/01/the-uncanny-valley-what-robot-theory-tells-us-about-mitt-romney/252235/" target="_blank">Exhibit A</a>. Basically, this (as far as I can tell unsubstantiated opinion) piece applies the theory of the <a title="Uncanny Valley at Wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncanny_valley" target="_blank">uncanny valley</a> to Romney's weirdness. Basically (yes, <em>basically</em>) the uncanny valley explains why <a title="R2D2 on Wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R2-D2" target="_blank">R2D2</a> is cute (yes, I provided a link for those of you who may have been <a title="GEICO &quot;Hiding Under a Rock&quot; Comemrcial at Youtube" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvXqm0RdJms" target="_blank">hiding under a rock</a> for the last 40 years) but something like a <a title="Realdoll (Not Safe for Work)" href="http://www.realdoll.com/" target="_blank">Realdoll (most definitely not safe for work)</a> is creepy. In this case the theory is that, as we get to know Romney better and see in finer detail how he's just a little bit off, we actually find ourselves more repulsed.

Anyway, pseudoscientific as it may be, I find the Romney-uncanny valley link amusing at least. We'll see how it pans out now that Romney is finally on his way to be the nominee.
