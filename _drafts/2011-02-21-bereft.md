I suppose the name is a little dramatic. It just came to me for some reason. I don't know why I haven't posted this song previously. Did I post it and delete it because I didn't like it? It needs a lot of work adding interest and sweetening the effects to make it nice to listen to. But none the less I thought it warranted posting as a song more than halfway complete.
