<p>I'm berry excited about the <a title="Renoise 2.7 on Create Digital Music" href="http://createdigitalmusic.com/2011/03/renoise-2-7-adds-sample-and-slice-savvy-tips-and-inside-info-from-the-developers/" target="_blank">new Renoise</a>. Take automated sample slicing with transient detection, for example. I've been planning (dreaming) on creating such a thing using the built-in Lua scripting, but I see they have done it. Or multi-band sends. I do this all the time manually with a string of various filters and sends to effect a drum loop's snare, hat, and kick differently. Lovely!</p>
