For example:

"My work explores the relationship between Pre-raphaelite tenets and football chants.Â With influences as diverse as Kafka and Frida Kahlo, new variations are created from both traditional and modern meanings.

"Ever since I was a student I have been fascinated by the essential unreality of relationships. What starts out as triumph soon becomes finessed into a tragedy of distress, leaving only a sense of chaos and the unlikelihood of a new reality.

"As wavering forms become undefined through frantic and critical practice, the viewer is left with a summary of the darkness of our condition."
