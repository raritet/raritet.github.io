<a title="My living sketching sketch." href="http://squishyrobot.com/processing/harmony/applet/" target="_blank">Here's</a> a <a title="The Processing language home page." href="http://www.processing.org/" target="_blank">Processing</a> sketch I made based on <a title="Harmony Web Remake at OpenProcessing." href="http://www.openprocessing.org/visuals/?visualID=8168" target="_blank">Harmony Web Remake</a> from <a title="The OpenProcessing home page." href="http://www.openprocessing.org/" target="_blank">OpenProcessing</a> (itself based on <a title="Mr Doob's Harmony sketching program." href="http://mrdoob.com/projects/harmony/" target="_blank">someone else's work</a>). It bogs down really fast, though. You can only draw a few lines before it becomes notably slow. I don't know much about data structures, so I don't know how to optimize it.

Either way, I think it looks really interesting. Each point moves around randomly. I would like to kill the points that lose their connections, to optimize it a little more. But most importantly I need to figure out how to only update the lines and points as necessary. But I'm not an educated programmer, so I think we will have to wait until I get a bee in my bonnet and learn about data structures.
