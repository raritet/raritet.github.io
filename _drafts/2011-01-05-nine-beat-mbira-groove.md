<a title="My Nine Beat Mbira Groove on SoundCloud." href="http://soundcloud.com/coherent-noise/nine-beat-mbira-groove" target="_blank">Here's</a> a groove I have been working on recently. I was picking through my music collection and came across this mbira thing. I took it into Renoise and a 9 beat section seemed to feel right, so I went with it and crafted a 9-beat beat out of a drum loop from the depths of my hard drive.

So this is what I have so far. Most of my time has been spent making it all fit together, learning about splitting the drum loop into frequency bands to apply different distortion to each drum, and so on. I have some ideas for where to start and where to go. But overall it looks like it will be an atmosphere more than a song, per se, as it were, so to speak.
