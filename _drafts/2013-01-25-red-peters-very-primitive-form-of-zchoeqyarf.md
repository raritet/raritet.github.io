The missus recommended that I read <a title="Kafka's Ape by Justin E. H. Smith" href="http://www.berfrois.com/2013/01/bananas/" target="_blank">this excellent blog post</a> from Justin E. H. Smith about "humanityâ€™s sense of its own uniqueness, which in the scientific age has been anchored to the nebulous concept of intelligence, [and may be] in the end nothing but a prejudice."

I finally read it last night.
