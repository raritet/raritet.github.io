In addition to posting my more developed ideas in the form of (highly informal) research proposals, like this one, I'm working on documenting my completed projects as though they were (heavily abbreviated) scholarly papers. I find that it helps focus the mind a bit. And it doesn't hurt that I dream of returning to academia at some point.

## The Meat

## Discussion

I have not provided this device to anyone other than myself to use for an extended period of time. So we do not have a lot of data on how people end up using it. That said, this is only a proof-of-concept; hence the cute appearance. An experimental setup would place the "guts" of a similar device in a wearable of some type, with the indication just visible within the user's field of view.

## Future Work

## Conclusion

## Acknowledgements

I should thank my family for putting up with me as I work on strange, apparently useless projects.
