Fun fact: John McCain's eligibility for the presidency under the "natural born citizen" clause is, in fact, not clear since he was born in Panama. And this is based on, you know, actual facts. From what I have read he is most likely eligible (or at least he's good to go in my book), but it really depends on the approach you use to interpret the law. Unfortunately, for nearly everyone I have ever met, the "approach you use to interpret the law" is the one that gives the outcome you want. Oh well.
