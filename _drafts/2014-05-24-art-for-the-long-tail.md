An interesting <a title="$8,793 Worth of [digital] art at We Make Money Not Art" href="http://we-make-money-not-art.com/archives/2014/05/8793-worth-of-art.php" target="_blank">article</a>Â and interview on new media art and selling new media art. My favorite quote, the title of an article by the interviewee Pau Waelder on the online art market <a title="Sedition" href="http://www.seditionart.com/" target="_blank">S[edition]</a>, is "Art for the Long Tail." That really sums up a lot of what it's about.
