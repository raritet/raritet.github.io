A friend of mine was wondering how a mix of alt-latin, indian stuff, and even opera might sound in a mashup. One of the examples he gave me was in a baile funk sort of style. So I took it as a little bit of a challenge and tried to make a little baile funk ditty with one of my indian samples collecting dust on my hard drive. It's really silly and totally ironic. Please keep that in mind.

Partway through the timing of the band changes a little so I need to go back and latch certain points onto the beat. But for the time being, this is what I have.
